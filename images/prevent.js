// if you are viewing my backend from github, and wondering why is that? okay... i deploy my apps on heroku, and i use cloudinary as assests(images) storage provider, to deploy the image on cloudinary i use multer to upload the file on the file system on images directory that you are on now, and then take the path and put it on cloudinary and then delete the image again from the fs, but heroku delete any empty folder, so when i upload a photo on the deployment mode, i got error, and that happens becuse there`s no images folder, heroku removed it, that`s why i put this tricky file. :)
console.log('PREVENT THIS FOLDER FROM DELETING');
